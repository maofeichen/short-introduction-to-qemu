# What is Qemu and What It Can Do

## System Emulator
When people mention "using a PC or a smart device", they actually mean that they use the operating system of it, such as using Mac OS or Windows for PCs, Android or iOS for smart devices, etc.

So what about running an operating system under another, such as running a Windows under a Mac OS, or vice versa, like a Matryoshka doll?

The question actually entails another sub question â€” can it run nested operating systems under same or different instruction set architectures?
