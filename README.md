I got to know Qemu since a dynamic taint analysis project, which I've been involving for almost one year. This short introduction to Qemu is going to become a summary of what I learn about Qemu.

Qemu is a huge project, the contents I'm going to touch here only accounts for a tiny portion of it. (I hope it's the core portion though) Since I only understand a small piece of Qemu and I can only introduce based on what I learned, thus there is no particular order between contents. Basically, it can be considered as blog articles instead of a complete reference of Qemu.
